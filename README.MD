# Fixing Python Script with Eventlet and Redis TLS

## Issue:
The current script using Eventlet and Redis with TLS is facing connection issues, and it seems that Eventlet monkey patching might be affecting the connection to Redis.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Update Libraries:**
   - Make sure you are using the latest versions of `eventlet`, `Flask`, and `redis`. Update them using:

     ```bash
     pip install -U eventlet Flask redis
     ```

2. **Order of Import and Monkey Patching:**
   - Move the `eventlet.monkey_patch()` line to after the imports but before any other code that relies on those imports. Adjust the script as follows:

     ```python
     import datetime
     from urllib.parse import urlparse
     from subprocess import Popen
     import eventlet
     from flask import Flask

     eventlet.monkey_patch()

     import redis
     import numpy as np

     # Rest of the script remains unchanged
     ```

3. **Separate Flask into a Subprocess:**
   - Use the `subprocess` module to start the Flask application in a separate process. This can help avoid interference between Eventlet monkey-patching and Redis TLS connections.

     ```python
     if __name__ == "__main__":
         flask_process = Popen(["python", __file__])
         try:
             my_application.run(debug=True)
         finally:
             flask_process.terminate()
     ```

4. **Testing:**
   - Before running the script, ensure that you have a Redis server with TLS support running, and replace the `REDIS_URL` placeholder with the correct connection information.

5. **Run the Script:**
   - Save the script and run it
