# Fixing Python Script with Eventlet and Redis TLS

## Issue:
The current script using Eventlet and Redis with TLS is facing connection issues, and it seems that Eventlet monkey patching might be affecting the connection to Redis.

## Solution Steps:

1. **Update Libraries:**
   - Make sure you are using the latest versions of `eventlet`, `Flask`, and `redis`. Update them using:

     ```bash
     pip install -U eventlet Flask redis
     ```

2. **Order of Import and Monkey Patching:**
   - Move the `eventlet.monkey_patch()` line to after the imports but before any other code that relies on those imports. Adjust the script as follows:

     ```python
     import datetime
     from urllib.parse import urlparse
     from subprocess import Popen
     import eventlet
     from flask import Flask

     eventlet.monkey_patch()

     import redis
     import numpy as np

     # Rest of the script remains unchanged
     ```

3. **Separate Flask into a Subprocess:**
   - Use the `subprocess` module to start the Flask application in a separate process. This can help avoid interference between Eventlet monkey-patching and Redis TLS connections.

     ```python
     if __name__ == "__main__":
         flask_process = Popen(["python", __file__])
         try:
             my_application.run(debug=True)
         finally:
             flask_process.terminate()
     ```

4. **Testing:**
   - Before running the script, ensure that you have a Redis server with TLS support running, and replace the `REDIS_URL` placeholder with the correct connection information.

5. **Run the Script:**
   - Save the script and run it using:

     ```bash
     python script_name.py
     ```

6. **Check for Issues:**
   - Monitor the terminal for any error messages. If there are still issues, consider checking the compatibility of the versions and consulting the documentation for Eventlet and Redis TLS support.

7. **Alternative Approach:**
   - If issues persist, consider using a different concurrency library or exploring other solutions for handling asynchronous networking with Flask and Redis.

8. **Documentation Reference:**
   - Refer to the official documentation for Eventlet, Flask, and Redis for any additional information or updates related to TLS support and monkey patching.

Feel free to test the modified script and provide feedback if any issues persist.
